<p>From the very beginning humans have had a mutual relationship with the natural world that satisfied their needs and with the Creator as Source and Giver of life. Perhaps the most ancient of the names people gave to the most observable and basic gifts of nature were the four elements held in sacred regard: earth, air, fire and water. Primitive and thoughtful people observed that these were indispensable for life; hence, the One who provided them was worshipped, striving to build or restore a sense of environmental awareness, a need that has risen in our own day as we experience a world population explosion. In the mid-1900s the population was about two billion people. In the beginning of the 21st century, it has risen to eight billion people. The effect is obvious. The need to change our patterns of distribution is enormous and ecological awareness an inevitable demand.

<p>Four major categories named these gifts: Earth, air, fire and water. Some examples identify the significance of these gifts both in their ordinary lives and in their recognition of the gifts of God. In recognizing Earth, the people fought for and claimed the land upon which they made their home as God’s inheritance. They sensed the value of the pure, clean air that allowed them to breathe and their crops and herds to flourish. Air provided a welcome coolness in the heat and could be warmed by sun or fire. Their boats moved more swiftly in a strong wind. Fire was another essential gift used to burn the sacred offerings to honor the Source of Life. The column of fire led them to the Promised Land by night, as did the cloud of moist air by day. Earth also provided places to hold the water and the fish essential for survival, for food and for industry as people traded for other necessities. These four sacred elements were honored not only by the Hebrews, but also in many other cultures, thus uniting nature and faith in Holy Being. </p>

<p>First, April and May call us to spring’s awakening of new life with the promise of longer days that give us flowering trees, gardens and the expectation of fresh flowers and food. Christian practice gives us a time of personal renewal. The season of Lenten renewal culminates in the 50 days between the Easter celebration of Jesus’ death and resurrection and the observance of Pentecost to share of his new life in the Spirit.

    Not all weather is pleasant. Some is as welcome as gentle rain and as the right balance of light and darkness, of storm and sunshine. Some is unseasonable; some is very destructive, the result of human interference in climate change, lack of care, or contamination of air and water by pollution. God-intended beauty and usefulness is destroyed by our selfish misuse. We must all work to cultivate and enhance these gifts of creation for the good of present and future generations. </p>
